BNet-Dark
=========

Dark theme for the site Bungie.net. 

What you are going to want to do is to copy and paste this code into a new style using the add-on stylish. 

In Firefox, you are going to want to leave the @-moz-document domain("bungie.net"){ at the top and the } at the bottom of the theme.

In Chrome, you want to remove both of them and in "Applies to", specify "URLs on the domain" and enter "bungie.net".

This theme is a fork of SM and Shou's theme, so thanks goes out to them both. Thanks also goes out to Zoid for some of his dark theme, L00 and Clint Beastwood for their help, and everyone else who has provided feedback in making this.
